## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a Mechanical Engineering M.Eng. candidate at Cornell University (B.S. Dec 2025, M.Eng. June 2026) with hands-on experience in aerodynamic design, wind tunnel testing, MATLAB modeling, and industrial research. Passionate about turning analytical models into real hardware—from 3D-printed wind turbine blades to SolidWorks valve components and Arduino robotics.

Experienced research assistant at Inline Industry (3 summers) conducting valve performance analysis and contributing to technical reports on reliability and materials. Current TA for Introduction to Aeronautics, providing feedback on aerodynamics and flight fundamentals. Skilled in MATLAB blade-element modeling, SolidWorks CAD, Python/Java, and experimental data analysis.

As part of MAE-4300, this project analyzed ethical failures in Boeing's 737 MAX development, focusing on the MCAS system through weekly worksheets. The work identified key issues like downplaying MCAS importance, omitting it from documentation, and prioritizing competition over safety. Deep dives into facts, assumptions, and ASME ethical principles highlighted conflicts between public safety and corporate pressures.

## Key Ethical Issues
Five core issues were narrowed from ten initial questions:
- Should Boeing downplay MCAS importance to avoid pilot training? No, violating Canon 1 (public safety) and Canon 7 (truthful communication).
- Should they take responsibility post-crashes? Yes, to uphold accountability and enable reforms.
- Should certification rely solely on FAA delegation? Independent review was needed to avoid conflicts.
- Should MCAS be omitted from plane documentation? Full disclosure was essential for pilot preparedness.
- Should competition dictate rushed timelines? Safety testing must precede market demands.

## Analysis Approach
Structured per week: identified issues, gathered facts (e.g., single AOA sensor risks, aerodynamic changes from engine placement), made assumptions (e.g., internal culture discouraged reporting), clarified terms like "safety" and "transparency," and applied ASME canons with hierarchies prioritizing public welfare. Practical constraints like job security and regulatory ambiguity were acknowledged, alongside prevention strategies at individual, organizational, and systemic levels.

## Possible Resolution

### 1. Downplaying MCAS Importance

**Issue:** Should Boeing downplay the importance of MCAS?  

**Resolution:** No. Engineers had an ethical obligation not to minimize MCAS’s safety-critical role.  

**Critical Facts:**
- MCAS directly controlled aircraft pitch  
- Pilots were not informed of its existence or failure behavior  
- Downplaying MCAS reduced awareness of safety risks  

**ASME Canons Applied:**
- Canon 1: Hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public  
- Canon 7: Issue public statements only in an objective and truthful manner  

**Justification:**  
Full disclosure prevents pilot confusion, upholds engineering integrity, and prioritizes passenger safety over training cost savings. Downplaying MCAS misled pilots and regulators about its safety-critical role, violating Canon 7 and undermining public safety.

### 2. Taking Responsibility After the Accidents

**Issue:** Should Boeing have taken responsibility after the accidents?  

**Resolution:** Yes. Boeing should have taken immediate responsibility for the MCAS failures.  

**Critical Facts:**
- MCAS design flaws contributed to two fatal crashes  
- Boeing initially shifted blame toward pilot error  
- Delayed acknowledgment slowed corrective actions  

**ASME Canons Applied:**
- Canon 1: Hold paramount public safety  
- Canon 6: Conduct themselves honorably, responsibly, ethically, and lawfully  

**Justification:**  
Accepting responsibility is essential for restoring trust, accelerating safety improvements, and learning from engineering failures. Deflecting blame delayed fixes and violated the ethical duty to act responsibly when public safety is compromised.

### 3. Reliance on FAA Safety Certification

**Issue:** Should Boeing have relied solely on FAA safety certification?  

**Resolution:** No. Boeing should have pursued independent or additional safety certification.  

**Critical Facts:**
- FAA delegated significant certification authority to Boeing  
- MCAS risks were not fully evaluated externally  
- Conflict of interest reduced regulatory oversight  

**ASME Canons Applied:**
- Canon 1: Hold paramount public safety  
- Canon 4: Act for each employer or client as faithful agents while avoiding conflicts of interest  

**Justification:**  
Independent certification would have reduced bias and improved system scrutiny. Relying solely on delegated FAA approval created conflicts of interest and weakened safety validation, undermining public confidence and engineering accountability.

### 4. MCAS in Documentation and Training

**Issue:** Should Boeing have left MCAS out of aircraft documentation?  

**Resolution:** No. MCAS should have been fully documented in pilot manuals and training materials.  

**Critical Facts:**
- Pilots were unaware of MCAS behavior during failures  
- Lack of documentation hindered emergency response  
- Omission was intended to avoid costly simulator training  

**ASME Canons Applied:**
- Canon 1: Hold paramount public safety  
- Canon 7: Issue truthful and complete technical communication  

**Justification:**  
Comprehensive documentation empowers pilots to respond correctly during system failures. Omitting MCAS information prioritized cost savings over safety and violated the ethical obligation for transparent technical communication.

### 5. Competition and Design Timelines

**Issue:** Should Boeing have allowed competition to dictate design processes and timelines?  

**Resolution:** No. Competitive pressure should not override engineering safety standards.  

**Critical Facts:**
- Airbus competition accelerated development timelines  
- Safety tradeoffs were made to meet market demands  
- Design shortcuts increased system complexity and risk  

**ASME Canons Applied:**
- Canon 1: Hold paramount public safety  
- Canon 6: Act responsibly and ethically in professional duties  

**Justification:**  
Engineering decisions must prioritize safety over market competition. Allowing competition to dictate timelines compromised system robustness and violated the ethical responsibility to protect the public, even under business pressure.
